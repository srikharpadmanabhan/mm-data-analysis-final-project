# march-madness-data-analysis
I would like to analyze the dataset about “March Madness”, found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nishaanamin/march-madness-data/data . There are lots of files and the data is public and available. I have not had a chance to open each file, but I plan on doing a few general things. First, I hope to get summary statistics about every team. Because there are so many files, and so many categories, there are almost infinite possibilities for which statistics to measure. I can look at things such as which teams consistently outperform expectations, and which teams come short. I can look at how offensive performance varies by seeding. Because these files have data from 2008 - 2024, I can see how certain statistics have changed over time. Additionally, because the data is split between regular season (and even here, conference games and non-conference games) and postseason, I can look at how the data for certain teams changes in each situation, and how that predicts the results in the postseason.

With all of these numbers, I want to construct charts and other visuals that could guide me to seeing which statistics matter the most and then hopefully create a relatively simple, supervised learning neural network that takes those stats for 2 teams and predicts a winner, and hopefully has good results.
